PFIndividualProject
===================
This project was made for the subject Programming Fundamentals I, and therefore it is not really production ready. 
It was tested on a MBP, but should run on any OS, as long as you have Python 3 and all the modules requested. 

To run, cd to the folder and run python3 main.py. This will create all the needed windows as well as fetch the relevant data. To quit, simply close the window. 

WARNING: The application will not scale, therefore it has to run on a display with a resolution larger than 1680x1050. If you have a retina MBP, simply set your resolution to 1920x1200 to be sure that everything fits on the window
